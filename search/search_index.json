The service uses the clamd daemon for the actual scanning. The data files of the dataset will be streamed through the clamd deamon one by one. If no virus is found the resume status will be \"Success\" , otherwise \"Failure\" with in the message the instantiated resultPostiveMessageTemplate . See the comments in the config.yml for details. The service has the following thread pools: Workers for incoming HTTP requests from Dataverse. These will schedule scan tasks. Scan task workers. These will loop over all the files in the targeted dataset and stream them through scand , gathering the results. The overall result will be determined a resumption of the workflow will be scheduled as a resume task. Resume task workers. These will try to resume the workflow. This will be tried a configured number of times because Dataverse has known synchronization issues in its workflow framework. References \u00b6 https://linux.die.net/man/8/clamd ARGUMENTS \u00b6 positional arguments: {server,check} available commands named arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit -v, --version show the application version and exit INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION \u00b6 Currently this project is built as an RPM package for RHEL7/CentOS7 and later. The RPM will install the binaries to /opt/dans.knaw.nl/dd-virus-scan and the configuration files to /etc/opt/dans.knaw.nl/dd-virus-scan . For installation on systems that do no support RPM and/or systemd: Build the tarball (see next section). Extract it to some location on your system, for example /opt/dans.knaw.nl/dd-virus-scan . Start the service with the following command /opt/dans.knaw.nl/dd-virus-scan/bin/dd-virus-scan server /opt/dans.knaw.nl/dd-virus-scan/cfg/config.yml BUILDING FROM SOURCE \u00b6 Prerequisites: Java 11 or higher Maven 3.3.3 or higher RPM Steps: git clone https://github.com/DANS-KNAW/dd-virus-scan.git cd dd-virus-scan mvn clean install If the rpm executable is found at /usr/local/bin/rpm , the build profile that includes the RPM packaging will be activated. If rpm is available, but at a different path, then activate it by using Maven's -P switch: mvn -Pprm install . Alternatively, to build the tarball execute: mvn clean install assembly:single","title":"Manual"},{"location":"#dd-virus-scan","text":"Service for scanning Dataverse datasets for virus","title":"dd-virus-scan"},{"location":"#synopsis","text":"dd-virus-scan { server | check }","title":"SYNOPSIS"},{"location":"#description","text":"Service for scanning Dataverse datasets for virus.
